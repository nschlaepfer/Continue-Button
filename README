# Custom Button Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension adds a custom button with an event listener to the OpenAI Chat website (https://chat.openai.com/).

## Prerequisites

1. Google Chrome browser installed on your computer.

## Files

Make sure you have the following files in your extension folder:

my-extension/
│
├── manifest.json
├── content.js
└── icon.png


## Installation

Follow these steps to install the extension in your Google Chrome browser:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing your extension files (`my-extension`).

The extension should now be installed and active in your browser. When you visit the specified URL (https://chat.openai.com/) and its subpages, the extension will run the `content.js` script, creating the custom button and adding the event listener as described in your initial request.

## Troubleshooting

If the extension isn't working as expected, consider the following:

1. Ensure the website structure hasn't changed and that the elements you're trying to interact with are still present on the page.
2. If the site uses dynamic loading, you may need to update the `content.js` code to account for the changes.
